## Practicals So Far
1. [RGB_Component_Extraction_And_Analysis](./RGB_Component_Extraction_And_Analysis): Read an image, split it into RGB channels and convert it to grayscale using grayscale conversion algorithms

2. [Histogram Equalization](./Histogram_Equalization): Perform histogram equalization on a grayscale image 

3. [Bit Plane Slicing](./Bit_Plane_Slicing): Extract and visualize individual bit planes from a grayscale image to analyze the contribution of each bit to the overall image

4. [Shannon Fano Compression](./Shannon_Fano_Compression): Implementation of Shannon-Fano entropy coding algorithm to generate optimal variable-length binary codes for data compression based on symbol probabilities
